This is a guessing game that I found the skeleton for online through the following link: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/A_first_splash.

I really wanted to work with a simple guessing game and try to mess around and make it fit my vision, but wasn't entirely sure where to start.  Rather than trying to reinvent the wheel, I decided to work through this project, understand the code, and then attempt to change it to fit the project syllabus and my own interests.  A lot of the basic site structure and HTML are the same, but I did some sweeping overhauls to the Javascript, including adding paragraphs to the site that track your guesses and the results (being high, low, correct, or your last guess).  I'm not pleased with how the style of the site turned out; I feel like I don't have a good grasp of how to make a site look good yet.  But overall I'm pretty pleased with how it turned out.

Also, I messed up naming the README file, but it made me laugh and I thought it was too funny to not include.
